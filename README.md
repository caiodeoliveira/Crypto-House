## An Important Note To Make:

### I work in this project as much as i can to keep improving him. I intend to continue the development here but theses days i received a Java demand to work in so i'm taking a break in his development to learn Java but i will back as soon as possible. when i finish the next version, the access link will be available in the Access to the Project Section. Thank you for the patience.
